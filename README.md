Note this is the last in series of presentations to the client, the end of the presentation might be good place to start if you want to understand the context of the projet better. The Main objective was to forecast Jackson Lake Levels to guide the national Parks service on the infurstructure plan at Colter Bay Marina. This comes at a time where the Marina is due for repairs as well as the increasing occurence of the water line at the marin being to low for the marina to be operational in the peak summer boating season.

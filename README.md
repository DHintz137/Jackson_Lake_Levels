The end of the presentation might be a good place to start if you want to understand the context of the project better (Type `o` to see the layout and scroll down to the page "Material From Last Meeting"). The main objective was to forecast Jackson Lake Levels to guide the National Parks Service in decision-making for the infrastructure plan at Colter Bay Marina. This came at a time when the marina was due for repairs as well as the increasing occurrence of the waterline at the marina being too low for the marina to be operational in the boating season (Late May to August).
